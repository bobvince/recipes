to taste salt






Directions:

1
Preheat the oven to hot (425F/220C/Gas 7)

3
If you wish you can add mixed dried herbs to add a savoury flavour.
4
When the fat is smoking take the tin out of the oven and place it over a low light so that it doesn't cool as you add the batter.
5
Pour in the batter If you're using muffin tins don't over fill.
6
Remember that the puddings will rise and puff up.

Put the tin back into the top of the oven as soon as possible and leave for about 20-25 minutes by which time they will be puffed up and crisp.
